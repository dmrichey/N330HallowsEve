/* to get enemy movement working you need to ensure the level is marked as static so the NavMesh
that is set up knows where to allow the movement script to go. You then make empty gameobjects and
name them waypoint,waypoint(1),etc... then drag the waypoint game objects on to the waypoints array on the script */
